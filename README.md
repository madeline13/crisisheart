Arduino code for a Bluetooth and GPS pendant that allows you to see that other devices, and therefore people, are near

The product is modular in both code and boards, since users should have control over their private information at all times. The Bluetooth module pairs with nearby smart devices only, while the GPS orients in an emergency.

Most times, both modules would be powered off.

The basics of the code are there, but I have to change random vibration to vibration in vicinity of a Bluetooth module.
